# Advent of Code 2023 ðŸŽ„

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2023 repository! This is my first attempt at participating in the Advent of Code, and I'm excited to dive into the daily coding challenges.

## About

Advent of Code is an annual event that provides a series of programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. The puzzles are released daily from December 1st to December 25th. It's a great way to practice coding, problem-solving, and learn new algorithms and data structures.

## Repository Structure

Each day's challenge will have its own directory, structured as follows:

/
â”œâ”€â”€ day1/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ day1.py 
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ sample.txt 
â”œâ”€â”€ day2/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ day2.py 
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ sample.txt
...


- `day[1-n].py`: My solution to the challenge.
- `input.txt`: The input data for the challenge.
- `sample.txt`: The sample input data 

## Learning Git

In addition to solving the puzzles, I am also using this repository as an opportunity to learn Git. This means I will be practicing various Git commands and workflows, including:

- Committing changes
- Branching and merging
- Pull requests
- Issues and project boards

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/advent_of_code_2023.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the day's directory:
    ```bash
    cd advent_of_code_2023/day1
    ```
3. Run the solution:
    ```bash
    python3 day[1-n].py
    ```

## Feedback and Contributions

Feedback is welcome! If you have suggestions or improvements, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. As I am still learning, any help is greatly appreciated.
